Artificial Narrow Intelliegence (ANI)
Artificial General Intelliegence (AGI)
Artificial superintelligence (ASI)

In narrow Intelliegence it perform only one task.
In general Intelliegence it perform multiple tasks.

ANI Examples:

Smart speaker
Self driving car
AI to do web search

AGI Example:

Artificial Intelligence will take a couple of decades to reach the artificial general intelligence stage and superintelligence stage. However, the transition has begun, and most businesses are incorporating artificial intelligence to better sales, forecasts and also gives new growth opportunities.

Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning: Just A to B mapping (Input classification)

Speech is input and model will convert it to Text.
Translate Chinese to English.
Self driving car
